# airflow

## features
* local development with a high quality DX
  * you get a full local airflow stack, so you can trigger it as if in airflow
  * you can run the command in a terminal and get full STDOUT from the program, but also color coded print-out of the interactions with the airflow orchestration
* onepassword secrets
  * built in, zero-config in DAG. You give it the secret name in 1PW, it gives you the value, right in the DAG
* support for picking secrets based on local/production
  * zero-config in DAG, based out of `.env`
* full control over production server configuration, yet remaining with perks of docker stack
* endlessly customizable python environment, including external, binary libraries built right into the container
  * based on bog standard `requirements.txt`

## useful commands
```
# üêö get a root shell on the scheduler, for example
docker exec -u root -it airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 bash
```

```
# üêö get a shell on a worker, for example
docker exec -it airflow-airflow-worker-1 bash
```

```
# stop all containers and execute this to reset your local database
# ‚õîÔ∏è do not run in production unless you feel really great about your backups
# ‚õîÔ∏è this will reset the history of your dag runs and switch states
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
```

## ideas
* make it disable all dags on start locally (default / main) so it fails to safe
* local docker socket pass down
* check for key on the other side of the webhook
  * makes a great demo of the 1pw integration and rotation
* disable the examples in production
